“I never wanted to be on any billionaires list. I never define myself by net worth. I always try to define myself by my values.” - Howard Schultz

Even pirates have core values. How about you?

*"I thought deeply about this. I ended up concluding that the worst thing that could possibly happen as we get big and as we get a little more influence in the world is if we * ***change our core values*** * and start letting it slide, I can't do that. I'd rather quit." - * ***Steve Jobs***

The secret sauce for Apple's success in the world of consumer technology can be attributed to the visionary leadership of Steve Jobs,the company's celebrity founder.

" *Steve built a company and culture that is unlike any other in the world and we are going to stay true to that -- it is in our DNA* ," Tim Cook, Jobs' successor, wrote in a staff memo after Jobs resigned from his post as Apple's CEO.

It's not just Apple, but every organization in today's world is investing heavily to identify and create strong **core values** in a measure to improve corporate **culture** and thereby improve **brand** identity, image, and employee retention.

## Personal Core Values Vs Corporate Core Values

> Are Core values a 'corporate' thing?
> Do only corporates have 'culture'?
> Are 'Brands' synonymous with corporates?
It was exactly a month back when COVID 19 had struck. The corporate world started to embrace WFH as the new normal.

It was then my mentee was 'vacationing' at home before starting off his new journey at Atlassian. We've had long hours of discussion as to why he *chose* ' **Atlassian** ' and every single time he concluded that it was all about ' **[VALUES](https://www.atlassian.com/company/values)** ' more than anything else.

Not to deny the fact that he knows 'values' *matter* most to me as he had heard me chant, 'Be known to be a man *of values* rather than a *man of success* ' a zillion times.

***“Values are like fingerprints. Nobodies are the same but you leave them all over everything you do.” - Elvis Presley***

I always believed that ' **we** ' individuals are ' **brands** ' by all means. And if corporates can define their culture and brand by setting their core values, ***why can't we define ours?***

Do I need to call out that it is always a luxury to discuss such topics with my mentee? *Mentorship - A learning platform where both the mentor-mentee grow...*

A week passed. As always, he did not disappoint me.

Wow!!! He came back to me with "Core Personal Values - Draft" - well drafted indeed. A glance into it and I was inspired to create my own as well by the end of the following week.

Identifying and creating a set of personal core values requires a fair bit of ***introspection*** * and * ***self-examination*** *. * What a soul-filling exercise it was,worth every moment spent!!!

**PS: ** Just Google. You will be spoilt for choices on how to do identify Personal core values. Ensure Core values are **your core, ** <u>Authentic, Clear and Self-Explanatory, Non-negotiables</u> that do not bend or break according to circumstances.

> Sit back, relax.
> Retrospect, define, reflect, refine.
> You are now a 'Brand' with personal core values defined!!!


## Well, how does having Personal Core 'Values' matter?

*"Your * ***personal *** *core values define * ***who*** * you are, and a * ***company's*** * core values ultimately define the company's * ***character and brand*** *. For individuals, character is destiny. For organizations, culture is destiny." - Tony Hsieh*

- Helps us define our **identity - Who am I?**
- Brings out our **strengths**
- Throws light on our **limitations**
- Sets **expectations ** to others
- Acts as **guiding** principles that dictate our behavior
- **Differentiates** us from others because they describe our **unique DNA**
- Good values are like a magnet – they **attract good people**
- Provides a framework for **decision making**
- **Sets our compass** to follow our North Star (direction)
Are you convinced enough to set your personal core values?

Believe me - even ***pirates*** had core values. Here's the screenshot:

*“Organizations, companies or individuals * ***without*** * core values are exactly like a * ***boat without an anchor*** *; it can be easily tossed to and fro following any direction the wind blows.” ― Dr. Lucas D. Shallua*

**To sum up: ** Core Values are the **basic building blocks** of our character and are fundamental in achieving our purpose. Core values, if created *genuinely* , have the power to shape your personal/professional relationships and the overall direction in life.
