Not a people-person? Quiet, Comtemplative type?

In the recent past, I have had several conversations with my mentee about how a person who is **not ** a ' ***[people-person](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/people-person)*** ' can build a healthy work relationship and improve their rapport with the team members. Here are some excerpts that can be of help to you:

I am talking about people who -

- prefer **not to have small talks** or even if they do - they want to move away at the first opportunity possible
- feel **awkward silence** is less awkward than anything they might say
- rather would **stare at their mobiles** than banter around the water cooler or at the cafeteria
- **turn down invites** to parties or withdraw at the last minute
- basically **want to ** ***escape*** ** and get back to ** ***isolation*** .
Are you able to relate with a *'yeah, it's me....'* kinda nod?

Then, you own an executive membership in the **"Quiet Contemplatives** " club. And yes, that's a pretty cool nomenclature!!!

> "First rule of introvert club: there is no introvert club. Thank goodness."
All along my corporate journey, I have observed such team members (predominantly people belonging to the 'High-performing Engineering' breed) and some of them who have spoken to me about this with a lot of guilt, being the person they are. They always feel that it has been a *blocker to forge meaningful relationships* with others.

**PS: ** No offense to the members of the **people-person** club. I'm a privileged member myself!!!

Let me tell you this.....It **isn't a bad thing** at all if you are not a people person. Believe this with all your heart.

It simply means that if you are one of them -

- You value being ***thoughtful*** ** ** over being an outgoing, gregarious person showcasing good communication skills.
- You are ***not anxious*** or wanting other people as an outlet for letting out your own energy levels.
- You ***avoid rash decisions*** ** ** and getting into relationships with people who aren’t compatible with you.
' **Quiet Contemplatives'** often prefer to keep their heads down and focus on work and can find socializing with team members to be weirdly draining.

However, it is equally important for you to focus on building relationships by adapting your traits to fit the expectations of the rest of the world. This can be done by maximising your strengths to the fullest extent possible without compromising on yourself.

Here are some painless things that you can do to **strengthen relationships** with team members without triggering too much agony to yourself:

## 1.Be Self-aware - Understand your strengths:

Your ability to be a thoughtful listener can win you utmost respect. Your observational skills will help you to provide important insights that would likely not glean if you spent more of your time and energy talking rather than listening.

## 2.Be authentic - No Sockpuppetry:

***"Be yourself--not your idea of what you think somebody else's idea of yourself should be." *** *―* ***Henry David Thoreau***

Don't make up false identities. Never force yourself into conversations or mimic an extrovert's personality. You are not gonna to sustain this for long. Stay transparent and authentic in every conversation and interaction. You are always seen as a person of great thoughts. Just be 'YOU'. Genuine to the core.

## 3.Communicate your intention - Say what you mean:

***“Intentions are nice, but ultimately intentions don't really matter because they only exist inside you.”― Kelly Williams Brown***

People will judge you by your actions, not your intentions. * Intent does not equal impact.*

You own a doctoral degree in *economy of words* . People decipher this attribute of yours as being *rude, bored or disinterested* . Don't let people assume.

In situations where you are not trying to respond as expected, let people know the reason as to **"why"** you are taking your own sweet time. It can be that you *don't know the answer* or *you are trying to process the question* or *taking a pause to reflect* .

Open, honest communication is the key ingredient for any relationship.This would be your primary action point in the primitive stages of relationship building - when you’re getting to know each other. Over time, your team will understand and support you better.

## 4.Find a compatible extrovert companion - your alter ego:

Having someone to * channel and lean on * definitely makes a world of a difference. Your extrovert friend will do all the talking for you and this would make you feel comfortable in a group.

## 5.Be a person of action:

Actions speak louder than words.

Be kinder than expected. Write people thank-you notes when they go out of their way to help you (cc their manager for extra points!). Send an email or slack message if someone gets married, has a baby, or has a loss in their family.

Compliment people on their work achievements. Be responsive. Offer help when asked/required. Give people the benefit of the doubt.

## 6.Start small:

***“It's OK to start small. As long as you start.” ― Izey Victoria Odiase***

- Don't push yourself too much. Stay cool— Rome wasn’t built in a day and you’re just getting started.
- Find areas of common interest. All you need is one thing to start your conversation.
- Say 'yes' to social events sometimes. Show up for a limited time and bow out early if you need to and then enjoy your solitude. (Don't show your frustration if you need to stay longer.)
- Use team lunches, networking events, all-hands meetings etc. as a jumping off point to get to know the team member(s). Try to spend a few minutes with them in a group setting one-on-one. Send a simple email follow up with your thoughts on the topic, or to ask further questions.
- Try getting to your meeting early and spark conversations beforehand to build rapport.
- Occasionally, take a coffee break with team members and talk about substantive work topics if you are not comfortable with small talks.
- Less WFH and more face time at office (Use video calls ...Covid times...)
- Don’t use conversational dead ends like "“How are you?”. Instead, use - "So what’s happening in your world?" **or** "Is there anything exciting that you are working on at the moment?"
- Start writing - it may be a sweet spot for you.
## 7.Try proven frameworks- The Four P’s:

**Jennifer Kahnweiler** , global speaker and author of **[The Introverted Leader](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16056951-the-introverted-leader)** , has laid out a well-tested, four-step strategy that can be used to build on your quiet strengths.

The principle consists of the “ **Four P’s** : **P** *reparation* , **P** *resence* , **P** *ushing * and **P** *ractice* ,” that’s meant to help you get ready for whatever social scenario you might be facing.

## 8.Retrospect. Reflect. Refine. Retry.

***"Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action."   *** *― * ***Peter Drucker***

One thousand days to learn; ten thousand days to refine. Make small improvements - Kaizen.

**Dr. Laurie Helgoe** , a clinical psychologist and author of **[Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life is Your Hidden Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3260326-introvert-power)** , quotes:

**“We live in a capitalistic, competitive society where rewards are afforded to those who act quickly, speak loudly, and prioritize doing over reflecting. Most of us who identify as introverts can think of a time where we felt like we were not making the mark, rather than recognizing that we’re making a mark of our own.’’**

> Go first. Do it your way. Start simple, and do it often. Believe me - it’s absolutely nice to be able to talk to anyone around you.
You can now not only build healthy **work relationships** but be some of the most **visionary, thoughtful, and relational leaders** in our organizations.

*Persistent practice is the key!!!*
