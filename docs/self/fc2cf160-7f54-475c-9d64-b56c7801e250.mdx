"Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else." - Margaret Mead

I always wonder:

Is "Being different" the same as "Being unique"?

"Being unique" simply means-

- You aren’t just trying to be different
- You aren’t just thinking of ways to stand out and put
your head above the crowd just because you can

- You aren't doing it just to blindly rebel against the rest of
the world

It just means-

- You offer something which no one else can offer or
replicate and everyone knows it’s You because that’s

your brand.

Remember-

- You have inherited a set of the rarest of rare possible
concoction of 48 chromosomes...

- You were gifted a chance to live - out of 3,00,000 billion
off-spring possibilities...

So, Status quo is not what "You" are meant for.

And, Conformity suppresses your uniqueness and replaces it with sameness.

Transform yourself from 'fitting in' to 'flying out'.

Embrace your uniqueness - with all your faults and limitations.

Let the world know you as you are, not as you think you should be...

"Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You." - Dr. Seuss

Be Unique. Be You.
